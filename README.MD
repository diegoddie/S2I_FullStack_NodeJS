2. Install Dependencies: `npm install` and `cd NodeJS`
3. Configure your MongoDB Database: Go to https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database and create a new free cluster DB. 
4. Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the MONGODB_URI variable with your MongoDB database URL.
5. Start the Application: `npm run dev`
6. Use Postman to try all the APIs (more details in the *API Documentation* section).
7. View Your Data in MongoDB Atlas: You can check how documents are managed in your MongoDB Atlas database to see the results of API operations.
